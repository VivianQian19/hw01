Hello, my name is Tianyi Qian.  

### Educational Background

I'm a grad student in the MAPSS program at the University of Chicago and I concentrate in **Quantitative Methods and Social Anlaysis**. I studied **Sociology** and **Media Studies** as an undergrad. I'm hoping to learn the following from this class:


* _data manipulation_
* _data visualization_
* _get more comfortable with programming in R_
